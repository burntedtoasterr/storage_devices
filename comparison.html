					<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Price</dt>
					<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One gigabyte of SSD Storage can be as expensive as two gigabytes of HDD Storage</dd>
					
					<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Storage Capacities</dt>
					<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most HDDs have at least 256GBS of storage and can go up to more then 4TBs,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unlike SSDs which begin at 128GBs</dd>
					
					<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Life Span</dt>
					<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most HDDs last longer then SSDs.</dd>
								
					<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Speeds</dt>
					<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSDs are a lot faster then HDDs at reading and writing files</dd>
					
					<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Durability</dt>
					<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSDs are more durable as HDDs are more prone to mechanical damages due to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their multiple moving parts</dd>
					
					<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Power Consumption</dt>
					<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSDs use less power then your typical HDD</dd>
					
					<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Noisyness and Temperature</dt>
					<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDDs make more noise and heat then SSDs due to their spinning platters</dd>
					
					<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Form Factors</dt>
					<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDDs are bulkier then SSDs making them unusable in smartphones and other small<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electronics </dd>

				<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</h2> 
				<h2 style="background-color:dimgray;">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinions, we find that SSDs would be the optimal storage device in most situations.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's sleek form factor allows it to be used in more devices and the no noise and/or vibrations really seals the deal. The faster boot times<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that SSDs provide for computers are incredibly useful and the quicker loading of data also helps in some applications, such as video<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;games. We think it's optimal usage would be as the boot drive, with mainly the applications that need to load and/or read data fast, <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereas a harddrive could be used as a secondary drive for other files that don't require as much speed. <br>
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So In Conclusion, even though SSDs have less storage, if you have the money it is probably better to go for an SSD(in most situations).<br>
