			<h2 style="background-color:dimgray;"> <!--puts text explaining what a hard drive is-->
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hard drive is a computer component used to store files. This type of storage device<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is used in many places including desktop PCs, laptops, smartphones, etc. Hard-drives  <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use disk-like platters that spin at high speeds(usually around 7000 revolutions per <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minute(rpm), however some higher performance models can go up to 10,000 rpm) <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to store data. To access data there are read and write heads which are controlled <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by motors that can magnetically write or read information from said platters.

			<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History of the Hard Drive</h2> <!--heading-->
			<h2 style="background-color:dimgray;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard drives were first created in 1953 by engineers at IBM. These engineers<br> <!--explains the history of the hard drive-->
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were trying to create a way to be able to have random access to high capacities <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of data at a low cost.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first drives developed had around three megabytes of storage and and was around<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the size of a refrigerator. As time went on, hard drives evolved to be denser<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while also increasing their storage capacities. By the mid-1980s, <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were small enough to finally become a standard in personal computers(PCs).<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, hard drives can hold terabytes of data, and are usually only <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a few centimeters thick.
