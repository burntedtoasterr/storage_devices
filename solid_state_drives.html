			<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Is A Solid State Drive?</h2> <!--heading-->
			
			<h2 style="background-color:dimgray;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An SSD is a computer component. Like the HDD, it is used by the computer to store<br> <!--explains what a SSD-->
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;files and data. Unlike the HDD, SSD’s have no moving parts, and instead use<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;semiconductors and flash memory to store data. Flash drives use a collection of<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transistors stored in a collection of rows and columns to record data. If an electrical<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current passes through a chain of transistors, the value of the data is set to one. If<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the current is disrupted, the value is set to 0. Each chain of transistors can store up<br> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to one or two bits of data.

			<h3> FUN FACT: A single MB today takes up 11 billion times less physical space than a MB did in the late 50's &nbsp </h3>

			<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History of the Solid State Drive</h2> <!--heading-->
			<h2 style="background-color:dimgray;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first SSD’s were produced in the 1950s, using different technologies to store data, <!--explains the history of an SSD-->
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as magnetic core technology and CCROS. Their usage quickly ceased though, with 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rise of cheaper storage devices. SSD’s saw some development and usage in the 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1970 and 1980’s, but their high price made them unpopular. At that time, the SSD could 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold up to 2mb of data. <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1991, the storage was increased tenfold. In 1995, the SSD we know today that uses flash memory was introduced, which saw their<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use in military and aerospace applications. Since then, SSD’s have evolved into what we know today, with up to terabytes of storage <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capacity, and their sizes much smaller. <br>
